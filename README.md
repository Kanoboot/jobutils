# jobutils
Simple job utils script that adds extra core functions to ox_core

I will add stuff like a boss menu in the future
Also will add locales because everything is in dutch now

Script shows a bridge example and explains some things about how to use ox_core 

There is a shared config for debugging and bridging. And there is a client sided and server sided config, for this script it doesn't really matter how you config your stuff, just know that server sided cofigs can't be dumped and therefor are a bit "safer".
